 * @brief Initializes the system tick service.
 *
 * This function prepares the time keeping facilities for non-blocking delays,
 * event scheduling, time calculation and even real time clock functions. The
 * underlying time keeping variable is 48 bit long so there is enough space to
 * count from miliseconds to days and weeks.

 * @brief Gets the current system tick value.
 *
 * Reads the lower 32 bits of the system tick counter. You can compare this
 * value with constants to generate delays or use it to measure time intervals.
 * The resolution and maximun time span to measure depend on operating frequency
 * and timer architecture.
 *
 * @return The current system tick value (a 32 bit integer value)
